        <p id="red" class="descriptions"><strong>Red dragons</strong> were greedy, chaotic evil creatures, interested only in their own well-being, vanity, and the extension of their treasure hoards. They were supremely confident, being the largest and most powerful of the chromatic dragons. Typically found living in mountainous regions, they breathed a cone of fire.</p>

        <p id="blue" class="descriptions"><strong>Blue dragons</strong> were manipulative, lawful evil chromatics who were infamous for their skill at creating hallucinations, and their cruel use of such things. They preferred aerial combat, which allowed them to use their electrical breath weapon most efficiently. Blue dragons most often lived in arid wastelands and deserts.</p>

        <p id="green" class="descriptions"><strong>Green dragons</strong> were highly territorial, deceptive, forest-dwelling creatures who loved secrets and intrigue. Although lawful evil, they were duplicitous and cunning foes who loved combat. Their breath weapon was a cone of poisonous green gas.</p>

        <p id="black" class="descriptions"><strong>Black dragons</strong>, or skull dragons, were the most vile-tempered and cruel of all chromatic dragons. Excellent swimmers who normally lived in swamps and marshes, they preferred ambush attacks. They had a corrosive acid breath weapon.</p>

        <p id="white" class="descriptions"><strong>White dragons</strong>, also called ice dragons or glacial wyrms, were the smallest and weakest of the classic chromatic dragons. However, they were by no means harmless. White dragons were extremely well-suited to their arctic habitat and had excellent memories. They were more feral than other dragons, though, and always chaotic evil. They breathed a cone of ice or frost.</p>
